# claim-o-matic

Just a form made with Bulma and Font Awesome and an "admin" page to list the entries and delete them.  
The backend _(if you can call that a backend)_ was made in PHP and it just saves the form entries to an CSV file or remove the specified row.

Thats all. This is just uploaded to keep a copy somewhere. _(Now I paste here my usual stuff from another readme)_
